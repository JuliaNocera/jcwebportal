I am using [this tutorial](https://www.robinwieruch.de/complete-firebase-authentication-react-tutorial/#react-application-setup) for the combined React, React Router and Firebase basics. 

Update: I have finished the above tutorial and opted, for now, not to buy the book for more. I have created a testData component to test writing simple data and displaying it. 

Next up: 
* more complex data writing, creating categories dynamically and ability to add to a category
* auth on category specific data

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
